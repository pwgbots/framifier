### A graphical editor and simulation tool in support of the Functional Resonance Analysis Method

Inspired by my first discussion with Arie Adriaensen, I recyled and adapted a significant part
of my Linny-R software to rapidly prototype a diagramming tool for FRAM. I first named it diaFRAM,
but then Arie observed that when you google this name, you are referred to "diafragm". On his
suggestion I renamed it to FRAMifier.

I intend to develop it further so that it will perform a dynamic simulation that is
consistent with the basic idea of FRAM.

My leading principle for software development is "functionality without fuss". I try to
minimize the number of elements of the graphical user interface, while maximizing
its intuitive logic.

The FRAMifier software is 100% HTML + CSS + Javascript. It should run in any modern browser.
Installation is simple: copy files and folders to a directory on your computer while preserving
the directory structure. Then opening `index.html` in your browser should do the trick.

Feedback is welcome.

/*
FRAMifier is an executable graphical editor in support of the Functional
Resonance Analysis Method developed originally by Erik Hollnagel.
This tool is developed by Pieter Bots at Delft University of Technology.

This JavaScript file (framifier-config.js) defines global constants that specify
the URLs for the solver, and for the sound files that are played when error,
warning or information messages are displayed.
